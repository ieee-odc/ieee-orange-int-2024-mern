AI Chatbot Project
Project Overview
The AI Chatbot Project is a web application that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to simulate intelligent conversation with users. Built using modern web technologies, this project aims to demonstrate the integration of AI capabilities into web applications for interactive user experiences.

Features
Chatbot Interaction
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLP algorithms to understand and respond to user queries.
Contextual Understanding: Maintains context across conversations for more coherent interactions.
Response Generation: Generates human-like responses based on learned patterns and user input.
User Interface
Chat Interface: Provides a user-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction with the chatbot.
Customizable Settings: Options to customize chatbot behavior or appearance based on user preferences.
Responsive Design: Ensures optimal performance and usability across devices and screen sizes.
Integration
API Integration: Backend API integration for fetching data or performing actions based on user requests.
Security: Implements secure communication channels and data encryption where applicable.
Deployment: Ready for deployment on various platforms, ensuring scalability and reliability.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
AI Framework: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar for machine learning models
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes (optional)
